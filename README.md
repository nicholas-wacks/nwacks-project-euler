## Synopsis

This is a simple repo for my solutions (and attempted solutions) at the Project Euler problems.
This repo is meant for my personal use for tracking my attempts, and to use as a showcase as needed.

This repo IS NOT intended as a source of copy paste solutions for people attempting these problems. 
By copying someone's solutions verbatim, you deprive yourself of the satisfaction and learing of personally completing the problems, as well as devalue the accomplishments of others.
If you are here looking for quick solutions, I'm certain that there are more well-documented sources out there that can at least help you understand the problems and solutions better.
